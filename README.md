#### Market Breadth Indicator Calculation from Raw Stock Data
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of market breadth indicators based on historical stock data, specifically the High-Low-Close (HLC) prices. The project follows the principles outlined in "The Complete Guide to Market Breadth Indicators" by Gregory L. Morris.

#### Project Overview:
Market breadth indicators play a crucial role in assessing the overall health and direction of financial markets. By analyzing a broad range of market data, we can gain valuable insights into market sentiment, strength, and potential trends.

#### Key Objectives:
1) Implement market breadth indicator calculations using raw stock data, with a primary focus on High-Low-Close (HLC) prices.

2) Follow the theoretical framework and methodology described in Gregory L. Morris's "The Complete Guide to Market Breadth Indicators" to ensure accuracy and reliability.

#### Project Features:
Calculation of various market breadth indicators, such as Advances-Unchanged-Declines, McClellan Oscilator, New High-New Low and Moving Averages.

User-friendly documentation to guide developers and traders in understanding and utilizing these indicators effectively.

Integration with popular data sources to fetch raw stock data for analysis.
